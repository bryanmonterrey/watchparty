   Press any liquid body and drag: a chain of beads is drawn out of its rim as
   a liquid finger, the grabbed body leans after it, and the release whips it
   all home on the house spring. LiquidMenu (the speed dial) is the reference
   implementation this engine was lifted from, verbatim — LiquidAdd and
   LiquidMorph run the exact same object, so the stretch cannot drift apart
   between components again.

   The engine owns the gesture: the math, the tweens, the release choreography
   and the press/click bookkeeping. Each component remains the owner of its own
   goo — blur, thresholds, alphas, the crisp-picture handoff — and hands those
   over as StretchHost callbacks. The engine decides WHEN; the host knows HOW. */
