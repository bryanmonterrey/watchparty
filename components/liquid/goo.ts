/* The goo filter's rim calibration — ONE solved table for the family.
   Ported verbatim from liquid-taffy (arknow91/liquid-taffy, MIT).

   Every liquid component draws its border as the sliver between two iso-alpha
   contours of the SAME blurred alpha, so how far apart those contours land in
   PIXELS is set by the blur: one fixed pair of thresholds would draw a
   DIFFERENT border at every σ — a rim that visibly fattens or thins the
   moment anything moves. Each working blur therefore carries its own pair,
   solved upstream by rasterizing the exact filter over a 32px disc and
   integrating the rim's ink, so that at EVERY σ the rim's outer edge lands on
   the CSS border's outer edge and its weight equals 1px of the rim colour.
   One border, whatever the liquid does. */
