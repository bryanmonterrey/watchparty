/* The seam — where a pulled rim and a standing rim find each other.

   Drag a liquid body toward its neighbour and, a few pixels before they meet,
   the goo starts bending the two borders together. This engine says WHERE that
   is happening and HOW MUCH, and hands both numbers to a gradient the rim is
   painted with. Nothing is drawn on top of the picture: the border keeps being
   the border, it just runs blue through the joint and back into its own colour
   a little way along each drop.

   Only the seams' positions, radii and strengths live here. The paint — which
   blue, how it blends back into the rim, how it is masked to the rim sliver —
   is the host's, in its own stylesheet and defs, because that is where the rim
   the light has to match already lives.

   ONE LIGHT PER JOINT. A single light shared between joints has to travel from
   one to the other when the strongest changes, and a slide of thirty pixels
   under a finger that moved three is exactly what reads as a jump — whether
   the switch is instant or blended over a few frames. So each joint gets its
   own layer: it lights where its joint is, moves only as that joint moves, and
   hands over by fading, in place, while the next one comes up in ITS place.
   Nothing ever travels between two joints. */
