/* Apple's continuous corner (the iOS squircle) — PaintCode coefficients.
   Ported verbatim from liquid-taffy. The dropdown panel draws its crisp body
   and its goo blob with this exact path so the two pictures share one
   silhouette. (The app's Lisse <Squircle> is a clip-path — no stroke — which
   is why the panel body needs a real SVG path instead.) */
