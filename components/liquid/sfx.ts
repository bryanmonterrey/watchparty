/* The liquid family's VOICE — a tiny procedural synth for gooey sounds.

   No samples. Every hit is built on the spot, so nothing ever repeats
   exactly: a drop landing twice sounds like the same drop landing twice,
   not like a file played twice. That is the whole reason UI audio made of
   samples feels dead — the ear catches the loop long before the eye does.

   ONE voice, shaped ten ways. Every sound here is the same little machine:

     a body   — an oscillator sliding from one pitch to another; the slide IS
                the viscosity, a fast one reads as watery, a slow one as thick
     a throat — a resonant lowpass sweeping with it; the resonance is the
                hollow "bloop" of a bubble, and where the sweep ends decides
                whether the sound is wet or dry
     a wobble — a slow LFO bent into the pitch: jelly, the same overshoot the
                springs give the picture
     a smack  — a whisper of filtered noise at the attack, the contact itself
     an envelope — attack and decay, and these are the character controls:
                everything above is a shape, the envelope is how hard and how
                long you press it

   And two CHARACTERS, one per frame, because the two stages are different
   rooms. Light is a shallow dish of water: higher, brighter, drier, quick to
   die. Dark is a deep vessel of syrup: lower, darker, wetter, resonant, slow
   to let go. Nothing else changes — same machine, same gestures, the room
   around it is what differs. */

   the light character is kept so the machine stays whole. */
