// The board's buy flow. Pressing Buy used to do one of two things, neither of
// them a purchase you could see before it happened: a Solana row fired a swap
// IMMEDIATELY at whatever preset was last stored (no amount shown, no
// confirmation, no way back), and every other row opened GeckoTerminal — the
// button naming an action, then handing you to a different product to do it.
//
// This is one dialog for every chain we hold keys for: the coin, the amount,
// and a confirm. Nothing here links off-site.
//
// COVERAGE is decided by two lists that are deliberately different sizes. The
// board TRENDS ~20 chains; the wallet holds keys for 8. `buyableChainId()` maps
// the first onto the second and returns null for the rest, so a display-only
// row says so instead of offering a button that throws. Solana routes through
// Jupiter, every EVM chain (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, BNB, HyperEVM, Robinhood)
// through LI.FI — see `lib/chains/swap`.
//
// LAYOUT follows two references the owner picked, in watchparty's palette
// rather than theirs: the coin header and the amount-carrying CTA ("Buy $200")
// from the first, the big centred amount card with presets beneath it from the
// second.
//
// The dialog owns only the modal chrome and the coin header. Everything under
// the header — amount, wallet, pay-with, details, the hold — is <BuyPanel>,
// shared with the coin page's swap card so the two cannot drift apart again.
